                  aphasia},

  abstract =     {Background: The background to this study is that
                  aphasiologists have increasingly started to pay
                  attention not only to the speech that people with
                  aphasia produce, but also to their gestures. As
                  there are a number of competing models about the
                  production of gesture and speech in healthy
                  subjects, it is important to evaluate whether, and
                  if so how, these models could be used to guide the
                  research into gesture and speech, and the
                  relationship between these, in speakers with
                  aphasia.Aims: The aims and objectives of this study
                  are to see how existing models of gesture and speech
                  are able to accommodate the findings regarding the
                  gesture and speech behaviour of speakers with
                  aphasia, in the hope that (1) these models could
                  shed light on the use of gesture in aphasic
                  speakers, and potentially suggest new approaches to
                  therapy for people with aphasia and (2) the aphasia
                  gesture data might help fundamental
                  psycholinguistics to evaluate the adequacy of
                  existing gesture and speech models. Methods \&
                  Procedures: The methodology here was
                  theoretical. Four models of gesture and speech
                  interaction were critiqued and we reviewed their
                  ability to explain some of the central empirical
                  findings in the area of gesture and speech in
                  aphasia.Outcomes \& Results: The outcomes and
                  results of this theoretical analysis were that, with
                  respect to the relationship between gesture and
                  speech in aphasia, (1) the four models under
                  investigation could be reduced to two models,
                  because three of the investigated models were based
                  on the same core assumptions and (2) both of these
                  models adequately explain these findings, but the
                  Growth Point/Sketch/Interface Model is more
                  satisfactory than the Lexical Access Model, because
                  of the better fit with the experimental results on
                  the use of gesture for facilitating word finding,
                  and because it is more compatible with the finding
                  that gestures are also used to enhance communicative
                  efficiency by replacing speech.Conclusions: The two
                  main conclusions from this study were that both the
                  Growth Point/Sketch/Interface Model and the Lexical
                  Access Model are compatible with data on gesture and
                  speech in aphasia, and that the former appears to be
                  preferable on the basis of the evidence available so
                  far.}

                  consisting of 100 hours of meeting recordings. It is
                  being created in the context of a project that is
                  developing meeting browsing technology and will
                  eventually be released publicly. Some of the
                  meetings it contains are naturally occurring, and
                  some are elicited, particularly using a scenario in
                  which the participants play different roles in a
                  design team, taking a design project from kick-off
                  to completion over the course of a day. The corpus
                  is being recorded using a wide range of devices
                  including close-talking and far-field microphones,
                  individual and room-view video cameras, projection,
                  a whiteboard, and individual pens, all of which
                  produce output signals that are synchronized with
                  each other. It is also being hand-annotated for many
                  different phenomena, including orthographic
                  transcription, discourse properties such as named
                  entities and dialogue acts, summaries, emotions, and
                  some head and hand gestures. We describe the data
                  set, including the rationale behind using elicited
                  material, and explain how the material is being
                  recorded, transcribed and annotated.},
