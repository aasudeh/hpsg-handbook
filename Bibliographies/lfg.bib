	Abstract = {Glue semantics is a theory of the syntax--semantics interface according to which the syntactic structure of a sentence produces premises in a fragment of linear logic, and the semantic interpretation(s) of the sentence correspond to the proof(s) derivable from those premises. This paper describes how Glue can be connected to a Minimalist syntactic theory and compares the result with the more mainstream approach to the syntax--semantics interface in Minimalism, according to which the input to semantic interpretation is a syntactic structure (Logical Form) derived by covert movement operations. I argue that the Glue approach has advantages that make it worth exploring.},
