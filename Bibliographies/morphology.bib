  ABSTRACT = {The AMI Meeting Corpus is a multi-modal data set consisting of 100 hours of meeting recordings. It is being created in the context of a project that is developing meeting browsing technology and will eventually be released publicly. Some of the meetings it contains are naturally occurring, and some are elicited, particularly using a scenario in which the participants play different roles in a design team, taking a design project from kick-off to completion over the course of a day. The corpus is being recorded using a wide range of devices including close-talking and far-field microphones, individual and room-view video cameras, projection, a whiteboard, and individual pens, all of which produce output signals that are synchronized with each other. It is also being hand-annotated for many different phenomena, including orthographic transcription, discourse properties such as named entities and dialogue acts, summaries, emotions, and some head and hand gestures. We describe the data set, including the rationale behind using elicited material, and explain how the material is being recorded, transcribed and annotated.},

In previous work we contrasted their approach with an approach which employs a more classical generalized quantifier analysis. In the present paper we synthesize the two approaches and suggest that this gives us the best account of the dialogue phenomena associated with RCH},

@ARTICLE{Purver:Ginzburg:2004,
  ABSTRACT = {Reprise questions are a common dialogue device allowing a conversational participant to request clarification of the meaning intended by a speaker when uttering a word or phrase. As such they can act as semantic probes, providing us with information about what meaning can be associated with word and phrase types and thus helping to sharpen the principle of compositionality. This paper discusses the evidence provided by reprise questions concerning the meaning of nouns, noun phrases and determiners. Our central claim is that reprise questions strongly suggest that quantified noun phrases denote (situation-dependent) individuals -- or sets of individuals -- rather than sets of sets, or properties of properties. We outline a resulting analysis within the HPSG framework, and discuss its extension to such phenomena as quantifier scope, anaphora and monotone decreasing quantifiers.},

@ARTICLE{deRuiter:deBeer:2013,
  ABSTRACT = {Background: The background to this study is that aphasiologists have increasingly started to pay attention not only to the speech that people with aphasia produce, but also to their gestures. As there are a number of competing models about the production of gesture and speech in healthy subjects, it is important to evaluate whether, and if so how, these models could be used to guide the research into gesture and speech, and the relationship between these, in speakers with aphasia.Aims: The aims and objectives of this study are to see how existing models of gesture and speech are able to accommodate the findings regarding the gesture and speech behaviour of speakers with aphasia, in the hope that (1) these models could shed light on the use of gesture in aphasic speakers, and potentially suggest new approaches to therapy for people with aphasia and (2) the aphasia gesture data might help fundamental psycholinguistics to evaluate the adequacy of existing gesture and speech models. Methods \& Procedures: The methodology here was theoretical. Four models of gesture and speech interaction were critiqued and we reviewed their ability to explain some of the central empirical findings in the area of gesture and speech in aphasia.Outcomes \& Results: The outcomes and results of this theoretical analysis were that, with respect to the relationship between gesture and speech in aphasia, (1) the four models under investigation could be reduced to two models, because three of the investigated models were based on the same core assumptions and (2) both of these models adequately explain these findings, but the Growth Point/Sketch/Interface Model is more satisfactory than the Lexical Access Model, because of the better fit with the experimental results on the use of gesture for facilitating word finding, and because it is more compatible with the finding that gestures are also used to enhance communicative efficiency by replacing speech.Conclusions: The two main conclusions from this study were that both the Growth Point/Sketch/Interface Model and the Lexical Access Model are compatible with data on gesture and speech in aphasia, and that the former appears to be preferable on the basis of the evidence available so far.},

@ARTICLE{Srivastav1991,
  ABSTRACT = {This paper argues against the view that Hindi has a single strategy of relativization, traditionally referred to as the correlative construction, which is typologically distinct from relativization in languages like English. It is shown that Hindi, in fact, has two types of relative clauses which are syntactically and semantically distinct. Hindi embedded and right-adjoined relative clauses are generated inside NP and function like noun modifiers. They are similar in essential respects to restrictive relative clauses in English. Hindi left-adjoined relative clauses, on the other hand, are adjoined to IP at D-structure. They do not function like noun modifiers but are quantificational expressions binding variables inside their scope domain. It is suggested that left-adjoined relatives belong typologically with free relatives in English and internally-headed relatives in Quechua, since they have certain significant properties in common with these constructions.},
