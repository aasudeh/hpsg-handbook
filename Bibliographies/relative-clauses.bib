  abstract =	 {This paper argues against the view that Hindi has a single strategy of
                  relativization, traditionally referred to as the correlative
                  construction, which is typologically distinct from relativization in
                  languages like English. It is shown that Hindi, in fact, has two types
                  of relative clauses which are syntactically and semantically
                  distinct. Hindi embedded and right-adjoined relative clauses are
                  generated inside NP and function like noun modifiers. They are similar
                  in essential respects to restrictive relative clauses in English. Hindi
                  left-adjoined relative clauses, on the other hand, are adjoined to IP at
                  D-structure. They do not function like noun modifiers but are
                  quantificational expressions binding variables inside their scope
                  domain. It is suggested that left-adjoined relatives belong
                  typologically with free relatives in English and internally-headed
                  relatives in Quechua, since they have certain significant properties in
                  common with these constructions.},
